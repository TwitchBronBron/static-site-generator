# Page Priority
Use the `priority` yaml frontmatter attribute to set the priority of how pages should be ordered in the tree. Notice that this file would have been first if it were sorted alphabetically, but we set out priority to 2 (the index page is set to 1) so that we appear AFTER [index.md](/index.html)
